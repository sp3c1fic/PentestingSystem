    <hr />
        <p>Welcome to our guide on network port scanning!</p>
    
        <h2>What is Port Scanning?</h2>
        <p>Port scanning is the process of probing a network for open ports on a target system. Ports are endpoints that allow communication between computers over a network. Each port is associated with a specific service or protocol.</p>
    
        <h2>Why Port Scanning is Used?</h2>
        <p>Port scanning is used for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security assessment: Identifying open ports helps assess the security posture of a network by revealing potential vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Network troubleshooting: Identifying open or closed ports can help diagnose network connectivity issues.</li>
            <li>Penetration testing: Ethical hackers use port scanning to identify potential entry points for unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Common Port Scanning Techniques</h2>
        <p>There are several techniques used for port scanning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TCP Connect Scan:</strong> Attempts to establish a full TCP connection with each port to determine if it is open or closed.</li>
            <li><strong>SYN Scan (Half-open Scan):</strong> Sends SYN packets to the target ports and analyzes the response to determine their state.</li>
            <li><strong>UDP Scan:</strong> Sends UDP packets to target ports and analyzes responses, which may be less reliable due to the connectionless nature of UDP.</li>
            <li><strong>Stealth Scan:</strong> Uses techniques to evade detection by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Legal Considerations</h2>
        <p>It's important to note that port scanning without proper authorization may be illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have permission from the network owner before conducting any port scanning activities.</p>
    
        <p>That concludes our overview of network port scanning. We hope you found it informative!</p>

        Here's why using a password generator is important:
    </p>
    <ol class="text-light">
        <li>Stronger Security: Passwords generated by this tool are typically longer, more complex, and contain a mix of characters, making them harder to crack through brute-force attacks.</li>
        <li>Unique Passwords: Using the same password for multiple accounts can be risky. This tool allows you to generate unique passwords for each of your accounts.</li>
        <li>Convenience: Generating passwords with this tool is quick and easy. You can specify the length and character set for the password, and the tool does the rest.</li>
        <li>Protects Against Data Breaches: In the event of a data breach, having unique passwords for each account helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to other accounts.</li>
    </ol>
